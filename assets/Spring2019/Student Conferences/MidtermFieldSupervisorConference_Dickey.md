# Assignments 

_The ABA requires that credit-bearing fieldwork provide a student with “a substantial lawyering experience that is reasonably similar to the experience of a lawyer advising or representing a client or engaging in other lawyering tasks.” The experience must “integrate doctrine, theory, skills, and legal ethics” and “provide multiple opportunities for performance.”_

# Supervision
