# Learning Goals & Plan

Good mix of substantive law and practical skills.

Observed hearing on employer's election objections in representation case.

Observed attorneys taking affidavits from charging parties in ULP cases 

Has been assigned two ULP cases for investigation. 
- Called charging party to arrange affidavit appointment
- Reviewed information provided by charging party 
- Researched cases and drafted memo

Working with different attorneys in office, getting a sense of how they handle cases. Supervisors are helpful with getting her up to speed on the law since she hasn't had the chance to take Labor Law.
