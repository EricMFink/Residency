Welcome to the academic component of your Residency-in-Practice!

As explained more fully in your Student Handbook, an essential part of
how you earn academic credit for your field experience in Residency is
the work you do with me, your Faculty Supervisor. In this role, I will
interact with you and your Field Supervisor to ensure a quality
educational experience. I will maintain a weekly presence with you, as I
read your learning journals. In addition, you and I will meet twice
individually (in person or virtually) and three times with your Practice
Affinity Group, similarly situated classmates in Residency. These
meetings are aimed at helping you learn, grow, and problem-solve in your
Residency.

As a Resident, you are stepping into the role of a lawyer-in-training
and of a professional in the workplace. To obtain academic credit for
work in a law or judicial office, per pedagogical best practices and
relevant ABA Standards, you **must** participate in substantial
lawyering experiences, receive feedback from your Field and Faculty
Supervisors, reflect on your experiences throughout the placement, and
engage in self-assessment. The structure of the course will help to
ensure that you meet these requirements, which are further explained in
your Student Handbook. This syllabus supplements the Student Handbook
with specific deadlines.

As a legal professional, you are bound by the Rules of Professional
Conduct for lawyers in your jurisdiction, as well as other rules,
guidelines, or policies applicable to your particular field placement.
You are expected to resolve any workplace issues and problems with the
attorney or staff person involved. Be proactive. Working through a
problem is part of learning how to be a professional. If the issue
cannot be resolved at the workplace, please come to me to discuss. If
need be, we will involve the Director of Residencies, Professor Cindy
Adcock.

**LEARNING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES**

In Residency, your learning objectives are front and center. Somewhat
uniquely in legal education, your learning objectives include not only
those shared by all students in the Residency course but also objectives
personal to you. As explained more fully in the Student Handbook, the
shared or common learning outcomes are:

-   the transfer of knowledge from the study of law to the practice of
    > law through the application of doctrine in practice, and the
    > bringing back of new knowledge and skills to the classroom;

-   a deepening in knowledge of the legal profession and a lawyer's
    > professional responsibilities, enhancing students' development as
    > legal professionals; and

-   an increased ability to learn from experience during and after law
    > school, through regular feedback from attorneys, self-evaluation,
    > and regular reflection on the lessons of practice under faculty
    > guidance.

Within these general objectives, you will identify and pursue personal
learning objectives for your Residency in consultation with your Field
Supervisor and with me, using a tool called a *Learning Goals and Plan
Memo.* The due dates for this assignment, along with other assignments,
are set forth below.

> **Note:** [Submit all written assignments in the related drop boxes on
> TWEN]{.underline}. If you have trouble with TWEN, please email the
> document to me to meet the deadline and then work to resolve the
> issue. When the problem is resolved, upload the document onto TWEN. As
> in law practice, it is best not to wait until the last moment to
> submit documents.
