# Overview 

Welcome to the academic component of your Residency-in-Practice!  

An essential part of how you earn academic credit for your field experience in Residency is the work you do with me, your Faculty Supervisor.  In this role, I will interact with you and your Field Supervisor to ensure a quality educational experience.  Throughout the term, as reflected in the schedule below, you and I will meet individually (in person or virtually) and with similarly-situated students in a Practice Affinity Group, to provide feedback and to wrestle with issues and problems that arise in the Residency context.  I will maintain a weekly presence with you, as I read your learning reports and journals.   

As a Resident, you are stepping into the role of a lawyer-in-training and as a professional in the workplace.  To obtain academic credit for work in a judicial or law office and to comply with relevant ABA Standards and applicable best practices for pedagogy in experiential learning, you must participate in substantial lawyering experiences, receive feedback from your Field and Faculty Supervisors, report and reflect on your experiences throughout the placement, and engage in self-assessment.  The structure of the course will help to ensure that you meet these requirements.  As a legal professional in residency, you are bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers in your jurisdiction, as well as other rules, guidelines, or policies applicable to your specific field placement. You are required to know those rules and policies. You are expected to resolve any workplace problems with the attorney or staff person involved.  The next level of working through a problem is with your Field Supervisor.  If the issue cannot be resolved at the workplace, please come to me to discuss.  If need be, we can involve the Director of Residencies, Professor Katherene E. Holtzinger Conner, kconner2@elon.edu , 336-279-9311.


#### Learning Goals 

In Residency, your learning goals and objectives are front and center.  Somewhat uniquely, your learning objectives include those shared by all students in the Residency course and objectives personal to you.   The shared or common learning outcomes are: 

      * Integrate substantive learning with practical experience and assimilate knowledge from the study of law to the practice of law. 

      * Transfer of knowledge through the application of doctrine in practice, and the bringing back of new knowledge and skills to the classroom; 

      * a deepening in knowledge of the legal profession and a lawyer’s professional responsibilities, enhancing students’ development as legal professionals; and 
 
      * an increased ability to learn from experience during and after law school, through regular feedback from attorneys, self-evaluation, and regular reflection on the lessons of practice under faculty guidance.

Within these general objectives, you will identify and pursue personal learning objectives for your Residency in consultation with your Field Supervisor and with me, using a tool called a Learning Goals and Plan Memo.  The due dates for this assignment, along with other assignments, are set forth below. 


#### Course Requirements  

To obtain the best possible educational experience and to meet ABA requirements, you must participate in substantial lawyering experiences, receive feedback from your Field and Faculty Supervisors, reflect, report, and self- assess on your experiences throughout the placement.  The course component for your Residency is designed to implement these broad goals and has the following components:  

* Hours in Residency in Practice (dependent on credit requirements of placement and accompanying course) 
* Assigned Readings from Faculty Supervisor
* Time Logs, Journals, and Reports
* 1 Hour of Professional Development with Report and Analysis
* Class with Faculty Supervisors and Students in your Affinity Group (2 x)
*  Individual Conferences with your Faculty Supervisors (2 x)
* Supervisory and Student Evaluation

Successful and timely completion of course work is essential to receiving credit: High Pass, Pass, or Low Pass.  Students who complete their hourly obligation for the requisite number of credits  may request to complete their on -site residency obligation one week prior to the last day of classes for the term and no earlier.  To do so, students must give prior notice and obtain permission of site supervisor and faculty supervisor. 

#### Grading 

Your grade will be based upon the following criteria and minimum requirements for a grade of Pass:

* Completion of required number of hours.  
* Timely submission of all assignments, including weekly reports and journal entries and time logs.  
* Professionalism in dealing with Field Supervisor, Faculty Supervisor, and clients.

Exemplary performance on-site as reported by your site supervisor and demonstrated in your written assignments and in Affinity Group meetings may result in High Pass.  A grade of high pass requires timely posting of all written requirements. If an assignment cannot be posted when due and you notify your faculty supervisor and receive permission to post late, the posting will not be counted late. If you post a report or journal late 3 times or if you post a time log late 3 times your faculty supervisor has the discretion to lower your grade from High Pass to Pass or Pass to Low Pass.     

Failure to meet the above standards will result in either a Low Pass or a Fail, depending on the degree of the gap.
