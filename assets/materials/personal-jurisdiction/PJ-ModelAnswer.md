# Problem

Dan operates a gas station near U.S. Interstate 40 in Greensboro, north Carolina. The station is frequented by locals and by interstate travelers using I-40. last summer, Dan changed a tire on an automobile bearing Missitucky license plates. The car belonged to Vivian, who was driving through Greensboro on her way home from vacation in the Outer Banks. A few days later, after Vivian reached Missitucky, her car swerved out of control and his an embankment. Vivian sued Dan in Missitucky state court, alleging that the accident resulted in his negligence in changing the tire. 

_Assuming the Missitucky long-arm statute allows it, would the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Dan be permissible under the U.S. Constitution?_

# Model Answer 

Personal jurisdiction refers to a court's power to bind a party to its judgments. The reach of personal jurisdiction is limited by both constitutional (due process) and statutory (long-arm) provisions.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "Since the problem tells you to assume Missitucky's long-arm statute would allow jurisdiction, you wouldn't need to discuss that." %} The requirement of personal jurisdiction ensures that a party will not be required to litigate in a remote forum without being on notice (actual or constructive) of the possibility. Because personal jurisdiction protects this personal interest, it is waivable by a party. In practice, the issue of personal jurisdiction arises only for defendants, as the plaintiff implicitly consents to jurisdiction by choosing to sue in the forum state.

A court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, consistent with due process, if the defendant's contacts with the forum state are sufficient to satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and if the cause of action arises out of those contacts.{% sidenote "sidenote-id" "There are no facts in this problem to support any of the other possible bases for establishing specific jurisdiction (personal service on the defendant while present in the forum state, consent, or waiver), so you wouldn't need to discuss those." %} The "minimum contacts" test looks to the defendant's acts, either within or aimed at the forum state, by which the defendant purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of that state. Independent actions by the plaintiff or third parties do not count. For example, where the plaintiff buys goods from the defendant in the defendant's home state, takes those goods to some other state, and is injured there, the defendant will not be subject to jurisdiction in the remote state, absent some conduct by the defendant purposefully aimed at that state. 

If the minimum contacts test is satisfied, a defendant may argue that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable under the circumstances. Courts assess reasonableness based on these factors: (1) the defendant’s interest in avoiding undue burden (beyond the normal inconvenience of litigating in another state), (2) the plaintiff’s interest in convenient and effective relief, (3) the forum state’s interest in the dispute, (4) the judicial system’s interest in efficient resolution of controversies, and (5) the state’s shared interest in furthering fundamental social policies.

### Minimum Contacts 

Here, Vivian has sued Dan in Missitucky. Since that is not Dan's home state (he presumably lives in North Carolina where he operates his gas station), personal jurisdiction over Dan requires that he have minimum contacts with Missitucky and that Vivian's negligence claim arose out of those contacts. The facts here are analogous to those in World-Wide Volkswagen, where a NY retailer sold a car to the plaintiffs, who then drove to Oklahoma, where they were injured in a collision allegedly caused by a defect in the car's design. Similarly, Dan changed a tire on Vivian's car at his gas station in NC, and Vivian then drove to Missitucky, where she was injured in an accident allegedly caused by Dan's negligence in changing the tire. In each case, the defendant's acts were confined to their own home state, and their involvement ended when the plaintiffs drove away from the defendant's shop. Vivian might argue that Dan should have foreseen that she would be driving to Missitucky, since her car had Missitucky plates. But in World-Wide Volkswagen, the court explained that the minimum contacts test requires more than mere foreseeability that the plaintiff might drive a car to another state. The focus is on what is foreseeable from the defendant's own conduct aimed at the forum state. Here, all Dan did was replace a tire. There's nothing to suggest that he specifically targets Missitucky customers through advertising, selling tires that comply with special state regulatory standards, or other purposeful efforts reap the benefits and protections of Missitucky through sales to residents of that state. 

Since Dan has no contacts with Missitucky, the fact that Vivian's claim arose out of an accident in that state isn't enough to establish personal jurisdiction over Dan there. Instead, Vivian would have to sue Dan in North Carolina. Assuming NC is Dan's home state, a court there could exercise general jurisdiction over Dan in any suit, regardless of where the cause of action arose. If Dan lives in some other state, e.g. Virginia, a court in NC would still have personal jurisdiction over Dan in this case, because it arises out of his alleged negligence in changing the tire at his NC gas station. 

### Reasonableness

If the court did find that Dan had contacts with Missitucky and that Vivian’s claim arose out of those contacts, Dan might argue that the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction based on the reasonableness factors. On the facts here, there is nothing to indicate any special burden on Dan, just the normal burden of having to litigate away from his home state. Vivian would have an interest in obtaining relief in Missitucky, where she lives and where the accident happened. Missitucky would have an interest in providing a forum for a suit arising out of an accident in that state. And there aren’t any facts here to suggest that litigation in Missitucky would be inefficient, or that it would offfend any other state’s fundamental policy interest. 

However, these factors are only relevant if the minimum contacts test is satisfied. Where it is not, as in this problem, the exercise of jurisdiction would offend due process and is thus inherently unreasonable.
