# Course Description

## Overview

The Residency-in-Practice course includes both a field experience and a class component. The class component is an integral part of the work for which you earn academic credit. As your faculty supervisor, I will review your writing assignments and meet with you periodically as a group and individually to discuss your field experience and issues related to legal practice. I will also communicate with your site supervisor about your progress in the field placement.

To earn academic credit for work in a law or judicial office, ABA Standards require that you participate in substantial lawyering experiences, receive feedback from your site and faculty supervisors, reflect on your experiences throughout the placement, and engage in self-assessment. The Residency course is designed to meet these requirements. 

During your residency, you are bound by the attorney disciplinary rules for the jurisdiction of your field placement, and other rules, guidelines, or policies applicable to your particular practice setting. You are expected to resolve any workplace issues and problems with the attorney or others involved. If you cannot resolve the issue yourself, you should discuss it with me. If necessary, we will involve the Residency Program Director. 

## Learning Goals

The Residency course is intended to advance these learning goals:

- Integrate substantive learning with practical experience, assimilate knowledge from the study of law to the practice of law, apply legal doctrines learned in class to a practice setting, and bring knowledge and skills developed in practice back to the classroom;
- Deepen knowledge of the legal profession and lawyers' professional responsibilities and enhance professional development; 
- Increase ability to learn from experience, through feedback from attorneys, self-evaluation, and reflection on practice experience under faculty guidance.

Each student will also identify individual goals and develop a plan for attaining these goals in the residency.

## Requirements

To receive credit for the Residency, you must complete these course requirements: 

- Field placement hours (based on credit hours for which you have enrolled)
- Reading assignments 
- Weekly reports, time logs, and forms
- One hour of professional development
- Two group meetings with faculty supervisor
- Two individual conferences with faculty supervisor
- Mid-term and final evaluations by site supervisor
- Student self-evaluations

Required forms, assigned readings, and report prompts are available on the [Materials](../materials/) page of this site and on TWEN. 

All reports, time logs, and forms should be submitted on TWEN by 11:59 pm on Friday of the week in which they are due (see [Schedule & Assignments](../schedule/)). If you encounter problems with TWEN, you may send the assignment to me by email and then submit to TWEN when you are able.

If you are unable to meet a due date because of your site supervisor's schedule, you should notify me to receive an extension. Extensions will generally not be granted for other reasons absent extraordinary circumstances.

If you complete the requisite number of hours early, you may request to end your field placement one week before the end of the term (but no earlier). Your site supervisor and faculty supervisor must both approve this request. 

## Grading 

The course will be graded on a pass/fail basis. The minimum requirements for a passing grade are as follows: 

- Completion of required field placement hours;
- Attendance & participation in group meetings and individual conferences;
- Timely submission of all forms, reports, and time logs; and 
- Professionalism in dealing with your field supervisor, faculty supervisor, clients, and others during the residency.

Exemplary performance in your field placement, assignments, and group meetings may earn a High Pass. Failure to meet the course standards (including but not limited to 3 or more late submissions of written assignments) may result in a Low Pass or a failing grade, depending on the extent of deficiency.
