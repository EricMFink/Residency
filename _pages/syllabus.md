# Description

## Overview

The Residency program includes both a field experience and a class component. The class component is an integral part of the work for which you earn academic credit. As your faculty supervisor, I will review your weekly assignments and meet with you periodically as a group and individually to discuss your field experience. I will also communicate with your site supervisor about your progress.

To earn academic credit for work in a law or judicial office, ABA Standards require that you participate in substantial lawyering experiences, receive feedback from your site and faculty supervisors, reflect on your experiences throughout the placement, and engage in self-assessment. The Residency course is designed to meet these requirements. 

During your residency, you are bound by the professional conduct rules and other standards governing lawyers in your jurisdiction and practice setting. You are expected to resolve any workplace problems with the attorney or others involved. If you cannot resolve the issue yourself, you should discuss it with me. If necessary, we will involve the Residency Program Director. 

## Learning Goals

The Residency course is intended to advance these learning goals:

- Integrate substantive learning with practical experience, assimilate knowledge from the study of law to the practice of law, apply legal doctrines learned in class to a practice setting, and bring knowledge and skills developed in practice back to the classroom;
- Deepen knowledge of the legal profession and lawyers' professional responsibilities and enhance professional development; 
- Increase ability to learn from experience, through feedback from attorneys, self-evaluation, and reflection on practice experience under faculty guidance.

Each student will also identify individual goals and develop a plan for attaining these goals in the residency.

# Policies

## Requirements

To receive credit for the Residency, you must complete these course requirements:

- Field placement hours[^1]
- Assigned reading, reports, time logs, and forms (as specified in the Syllabus)[^2]
- One hour of professional development
- Individual conferences and group meetings with faculty supervisor
- Midterm conference with site supervisor and faculty supervisor

[^1]: If you complete the requisite number of hours early, you may request to end your field placement one week before the end of the term (but no earlier). Your site supervisor and faculty supervisor must both approve this request. 

[^2]: Report prompts, time log, and other required forms are posted on TWEN. 

Unless specifically authorized by the faculty or site supervisor, you may not use generative AI services in any work required for this course.

All forms, weekly time logs, and reports should be submitted on TWEN by 11:59 pm on Friday of the week in which they are due (see _Schedule & Assignments_ below). If you encounter problems with TWEN, you may send the assignment to me by email and then submit it to TWEN when you are able.

If you are unable to meet a due date because of your site supervisor's schedule, you should notify me to receive an extension. Extensions will generally not be granted for other reasons absent compelling circumstances.

## Grading 

The course will be graded on a pass/fail basis, based on these standards: 

- Completion of required field placement hours;
- Attendance & participation in group meetings and individual conferences;
- Timely submission of all forms, reports, and time logs; and 
- Professionalism in dealing with your field supervisor, faculty supervisor, clients, and others during the residency.

Exemplary performance in your field placement, assignments, and group meetings may earn a High Pass. Failure to meet these standards may result in a Low Pass or a failing grade.

## Disability Accommodations

For disability accommodation requests, contact [Tammy Horn](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/directory/profile/?user=thorn), Director of Academic and Administrative Services.
